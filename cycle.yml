description: "An All In One Drupal Container"

# Here is where we list our containers. You can have as many as you want.
containers:

  # Usually the same as the hostname.

    # Will appear in the portal under this name - can be anything.

    image: 

      # The name to give the image when it is imported. 
      # This is for your purposes only.
      name: Drupal

      # When set to true, Cycle will preemptively download (and keep) 
      # the image on all applicable (using tags) servers.
      # This allows for near instant start time of the container, 
      # at the cost of drive space.
      preload: false

      # The source describes where to get the prebuilt image, 
      # or where to find the Dockerfile.
      source: 

        # If building from source on Cycle, use this to point to the path
        # where the Dockerfile is within this repo. Omit the Dockerfile
        # at the end.

      # and with the public internet.
      network: 
        # The hostname is the name the container uses to identify itself 
        # on the private network.

        # if it detects the process has died.
